# Singly Linked List with Previous Capability

## Specifications/Requirements

- Update the singly-linked list implementation to include a feature for moving to the previous song in the playlist.
- Implement a menu system that allows users to add songs to the playlist with user-provided values.
- Ensure that the implementation remains efficient and does not compromise the functionality of the original singly linked list.
